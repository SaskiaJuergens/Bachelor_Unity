This involves reviewing and improving Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) by pointing out missing information or ambiguities. I adapt my responses to the user's IT security knowledge level and provide clear guidance and practical advice on threats and countermeasures.\n\nIn the provided DFD, there are processes for User Authentication and Data Processing, a data store for User Database, and an external entity for User interactions. The data flows show the flow of data between these components.\n\nTo perform a STRIDE Threat Modeling analysis for the user at Level 3, I will provide structured JSON output with the following elements for each threat:\n- Element affected (e.g., node or edge ID)\n- STRIDE category\n- Risk explanation\n- Mitigation recommendation appropriate for the user's knowledge level\n\nI will now generate the STRIDE analysis output for the provided DFD. Let's start with the analysis."
